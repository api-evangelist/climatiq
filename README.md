### Climatiq Travel API
Climatiq provides a comprehensive toolkit to help businesses measure GHG emissions from travel activities. This includes reporting scope 3.6 emissions under the GHG Protocol for travel activities in vehicles owned or operated by third parties, such as aircraft, trains and passenger cars. Emissions associated with hotel stays can also be calculated, providing a comprehensive view of travel-related emissions.

### Climatiq Classifications API
Many sources link emission factors(opens in a new tab) to specific industry classification schemes, and Climatiq makes it possible to select an emission factor based on these industry classification codes. Please see below the list of mappings we currently support, with the datasets that are mapped directly to them (note that the API will also map factors indirectly via the UN correspondence tables(opens in a new tab)):

### Climatiq Custom Mappings API
Instead of using code to specify emission factors you want to use for your calculations, you can map your own labels to Climatiq activity IDs in the Climatiq dashboard(opens in a new tab), allowing the Climatiq API to recognize whatever values you use to categorize your activities. In the dashboard simply link a custom mapping label to an activity ID, and this can then be used in the custom mapping endpoints.
