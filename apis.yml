      Climatiq provides a comprehensive toolkit to help businesses measure GHG
      emissions from travel activities. This includes reporting scope 3.6
      emissions under the GHG Protocol for travel activities in vehicles owned
      or operated by third parties, such as aircraft, trains and passenger cars.
      Emissions associated with hotel stays can also be calculated, providing a
      comprehensive view of travel-related emissions.

      Many sources link emission factors(opens in a new tab) to specific
      industry classification schemes, and Climatiq makes it possible to select
      an emission factor based on these industry classification codes. Please
      see below the list of mappings we currently support, with the datasets
      that are mapped directly to them (note that the API will also map factors
      indirectly via the UN correspondence tables(opens in a new tab)):

      The energy endpoints automatically calculates the greenhouse gas emissions
      associated with the consumed energy based on relevant emission factors.
      These factors are determined based on the specific type of energy and the
      region where it is consumed, ensuring accurate carbon footprint
      calculations for your organization.

      Instead of using code to specify emission factors you want to use for your
      calculations, you can map your own labels to Climatiq activity IDs in the
      Climatiq dashboard(opens in a new tab), allowing the Climatiq API to
      recognize whatever values you use to categorize your activities. In the
      dashboard simply link a custom mapping label to an activity ID, and this
      can then be used in the custom mapping endpoints.
